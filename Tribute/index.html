      <h2>✨ Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity—one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is best known for his equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t just a scientist—he was a dreamer, a thinker, and a humanitarian. He spoke out for civil rights, world peace, and education.</p>
      <p>His creativity and courage to challenge existing beliefs is what makes him truly admirable. He proved that imagination is the root of innovation.</p>
      <blockquote>“Imagination is more important than knowledge.”</blockquote>
